# Results

## Missing values in the original dataset

Table 1 shows how the number of outcome events increase when missing zip codes are imputed under the various imputation approaches employed.
In all datasets the ID pool remains unchanged, meaning no participant that was dropped was recovered after the imputation approaches evaluated.
Only a small number of new outcome events are gained when the multiple observations per individuals are considered.
The distribution of frequencies of the SES categories vary slightly between approaches, but these proportions appear to be robust to changes in the underlying zip code imputations.

After dropping incomplete cases to inspect the data available to the model, we can anticipate how the model might be impacted by the imputations (Table 2).
Surprisingly all three datasets under the "single observation per individual" approach are the same, and this was validated by the `all.equal()` function that performs a binary comparison between data frames.
No changes to the data available for modelling can be detected using any of the imputation approaches for this dataset.


Table: **Table 2** Number of death events available to models in each dataset

|dataset        |   n|
|:--------------|---:|
|sing_cc        | 693|
|sing_locf      | 693|
|sing_locf+nocb | 693|
|mult_cc        |   2|
|mult_locf      | 694|
|mult_locf+nocb | 694|

Under the "multiple observations per individual" approach, most outcome events are dropped for the complete case dataset.
This happens because that dataset uses the exposure at discharge, but there are no Zip codes recorded for that measurement time.
This way no DCI scores were available for most individuals, resulting in a sample of size 2 (Table 2).
By applying the binary comparison between the two imputation approaches we found that both LOCF and LOCF+NOCB data frames are equal.
A single outcome event was added to those datasets after the imputation is applied to the underlying SES data.

This leaves only two datasets to perform the sensitivity analysis on: one dataset under the "single observations per individual" (regardless of whether an imputation was applied) and one using the "multiple observations per individual" approaches (using any imputation).
For simplicity, we will consider the complete case dataset for the first case and the LOCF for the second one.

## Inferential analysis

- FIMCOG4 is included in single CC (table 4)
- FIMMOTD4 and FIMCOG4 are included in multiple LOCF
- Days to rehab is included in multiple LOCF
- multiple: time-varying exposure is associated with the outcome up to model 5 (clinical+FIM scores)
