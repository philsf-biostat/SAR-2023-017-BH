# Context

## Objectives

<!-- ## Data reception and cleaning -->

# Methods

The data procedures, design and analysis methods used in this report are fully described in the annex document **SAP-2023-017-BH-v01**.

<!-- ## Study parameters -->

<!-- ### Study design -->

<!-- ### Inclusion and exclusion criteria -->

<!-- ### Exposures -->

<!-- ### Outcomes -->

<!-- ### Covariates -->

<!-- ## Statistical analyses -->

This analysis was performed using statistical software `R` version 4.3.0.

# Results

## Study population and follow up

- no changes to the id pool
- slight shift in SES props, but similar overall (also, still homogeneously distributed)

After dropping incomplete cases (data available to the model)

- few individuals lost after complete-cases deletion
<!-- ("lost" data frame) -->
- Single: all Single datasets are equal
- multiple:: most deaths are dropped in multiple CC (ZIP not recorded -> no SES)
- multiple: LOCF is equal to LOCF+NOCB
- single death added


Table: **Table 2** Number of death events available to models in each dataset

|dataset        |   n|
|:--------------|---:|
|sing_cc        | 693|
|sing_locf      | 693|
|sing_locf+nocb | 693|
|mult_cc        |   2|
|mult_locf      | 694|
|mult_locf+nocb | 694|

## Inferential analysis

- FIMCOG4 is included in single CC (table 4)
- FIMMOTD4 and FIMCOG4 are included in multiple LOCF
- Days to rehab is included in multiple LOCF
- multiple: time-varying exposure is associated with the outcome up to model 5 (clinical+FIM scores)
