# Abbreviations

- BMI: body mass index
- CI: confidence interval
- CV: coefficient of variation
- d: Cohen's D effect size
- HR: hazards ratio
- IQR: interquartile range
- IRR: incidence rate ratio
- OR: odds ratio
- RR: risks ratio
- SD: standard deviation

# Context

## Objectives

1. To describe the missingness in zip codes at each follow up collection;
1. To impute missing Zip codes with data available in previous follow up collections.
1. To assess the sensitivity of the association between mortality and socioeconomic status to the imputation of participant missing location.

## Hypotheses

# Data

## Raw data

The original data base had
711
variables collected on
76665
observations.

<!-- Upon study start the raw data will be collected in a raw table, that will be processed before analysis. -->
<!-- The raw dataset to be collected will have -->
<!-- 711 -->
<!-- variables collected on -->
<!-- 76665 -->
<!-- observations. -->

<!-- This dataset will include the dates of entry and exit of the cohort, or the date of hospital admission and the date where the endpoint was reached (either an event, or hospital discharge). -->
<!-- Table 1 shows the structure of the raw dataset. -->

<!-- ```{r analytical data} -->
<!-- analytical_mockup %>% -->
<!--   pander(caption = "**Table 1** Raw dataset structure.") -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Each row represents all information collected from each study participant, and each participant included will require a unique study ID. -->
<!-- The outcome should be recorded as a binary variable: either the study participant reached the endpoint -->
<!-- ([outcome]) -->
<!-- or reached the end of study period without experiencing the event. -->
<!-- This information can be recorded in either text form (eg, yes/no), or an indicator -->
<!-- ([outcome] = 1, -->
<!-- end of observation time or discharge = 0). -->
<!-- Exposure and all comorbidities should be recorded as binary variables, whenever possible. -->
<!-- All comorbidities should be recorded as binary variables, whenever possible. -->

<!-- Surgery length should be recorded in -->
<!-- minutes, -->
<!-- hours, -->
<!-- and ICU length in -->
<!-- days. -->
<!-- weeks. -->
<!-- months. -->

<!-- Surgery type will be recorded as a categorical variable. -->
<!-- It is recommended that the number of classes (types of surgery) be as small as possible, to avoid loss of precision in the analysis estimates, without the need to increase the sample size. -->
<!-- Broader categories of surgeries should be preferred, whenever possible. -->

## Analytical dataset

<!-- After the cleaning process -->
<!-- 24 -->
<!-- variables were included in the analysis -->
<!-- with -->
<!-- 7978 -->
<!-- observations. -->
After the cleaning process
24
variables were included in the analysis.
The total number of observations excluded due to incompleteness and exclusion criteria will be reported in the analysis.
Table 1 shows the structure of the analytical dataset.

## Statistical analyses

### Descriptive analyses

The epidemiological profile of the study participants will be described.
Demographic
(sex, age and BMI)
and clinical variables
<!-- ( [vars] ) -->
will be described as
mean (SD)
<!-- median (IQR) -->
or as counts and proportions (%), as appropriate.
The distributions of participants' characteristics will be summarized in tables and visualized in exploratory plots.

### Inferential analyses

All comparisons between groups will be performed as univariate analyses.
Continuous variables will be compared between groups with the
independent t test with Welch correction.
<!-- paired t test. -->
<!-- Mann-Whitney test. -->
<!-- signed rank Wilcoxon test. -->
Differences in distribution of categorical variables will be assessed with the
Fisher exact test.
<!-- chi-square test. -->
<!-- McNemar test. -->

<!-- All inferential analyses will be performed in the statistical models (described in the next section). -->

### Statistical modeling

### Missing data

No missing data imputation will be performed.
All evaluations will be performed as complete case analyses.
Missing data counts and proportions will be reported in tables.

## Significance and Confidence Intervals

All analyses will be performed using the significance level of 5%.
All significance hypothesis tests and confidence intervals computed will be
two-tailed.
<!-- left-tailed. -->
<!-- right-tailed. -->

## Study size and Power

N/A

## Statistical packages

This analysis will be performed using statistical software `R` version 4.3.0.

# Observations and limitations

**Recommended reporting guideline**

The adoption of the EQUATOR network (<http://www.equator-network.org/>) reporting guidelines have seen increasing adoption by scientific journals.
All observational studies are recommended to be reported following the STROBE guideline (von Elm et al, 2014).
<!-- All clinical trials are recommended to be reported following the CONSORT guideline (Schulz K F, Altman D G, Moher D., 2010). -->
<!-- All systematic reviews are recommended to be reported following the PRISMA guideline (Page et al, 2021). -->
<!-- All protocols for systematic reviews are recommended to be reported following the PRISMA-P guideline (Page et al, 2021). -->

<!-- In particular when a retrospective study is conducted using hospital records, it is recommended that the RECORD extension of the STROBE guideline is considered (Benchimol et al, 2015). -->
